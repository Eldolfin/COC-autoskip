Using adb, this program
1. Asks the user the wanted gold and elixir (summed)
1. Starts searching
1. Skips until it sees a village fulfilling the requirements
1. Plays a sound effect once it finds one

It does it by taking a screenshot of the device, sending it to the computer
and processing it using the Tesseract OCR engine.

It's not 100% accurate at the moment, it might skip villages it shouldn't.
But it's fairly rare.

## TODO:
- [ ] Add desktop notifications
- [ ] Add better logging, showing stats
- [ ] Pass images to OCR without saving them on the disk
- [ ] Add tests

## Purpose of this project:
Spending less time playing, instead watching the computer play for youüóø
